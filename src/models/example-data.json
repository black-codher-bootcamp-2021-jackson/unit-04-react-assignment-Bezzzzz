    "longDescription": "In the seventh season premiere of \"The Real Housewives of Orange County,\" the women all find themselves dealing with lingering drama from last year. As Vicki finalizes her divorce, she's focused on finding happiness, starting with putting the house up for sale and spending time with her new man, Brooks. Busy mom Alexis has a new job as a morning news show correspondent, and after a three-year feud, Tamra and Gretchen meet to bury the hatchet once and for all. Tamra continues to sell real estate to make ends meet, and shows a very expensive property to filthy rich Heather Dubrow - a former actress, now mother of four - whom she later invites to a dinner party at Vicki's house. With tensions high and patience low, Peggy and Alexis come face to face for the first time since last year's bombshell revelation that Peggy dated Alexis' husband. Will the dinner party be a recipe for disaster?"

Inspired, he suddenly realises his life’s ambition: to leave behind mind-numbing Orange County and study creative writing with Skinner at Stanford University. But after being denied enrollment due to an admissions error, Shaun is forced to seek help not only from his girlfriend Ashley (Schuyler Fisk) but also his hopelessly dysfunctional parents (Catherine O’Hara & John Lithgow), stoner brother Lance (Jack Black), and a host of hilarious circumstances to make his dream of escaping his hometown nightmare a reality."

When Tamra tells Vicki about Slade's comedy routine, she feels insulted, but is distracted by her daughter Briana's upcoming thyroid surgery, which could reveal if she has cancer. Alexis works herself into a frenzy over her upcoming nose surgery because she's convinced that her doctor must remove her nose entirely from her face to take off the bump. At Tamra's '80s-themed Bunco Party, a friend brings up Slade's jokes and a simmering controversy explodes into full-on conflict. While Gretchen jumps to Slade's defense, Tamra tries to diffuse the situation by revealing a surprise - much to Vicki's horror."

Confronted immediately about the insulting things he said about Vicki in his comedy routine, Slade aggressively defends himself. And though Vicki tries to make a graceful exit, she soon finds herself drawn back inside to have the last word. Jumping to Slade's defense, Gretchen and Vicki get into a vicious screaming match, where Gretchen accuses Vicki of being a hypocrite. And just when everyone thinks the drama is over, Alexis gets defensive when Tamra and Heather call her out on her upcoming nose job. Later, once the party drama has passed, Alexis goes in for her surgery, and Vicki's daughter Briana heads to the hospital to have her thyroid removed, fearing the worst - cancer."
